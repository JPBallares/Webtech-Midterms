        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to specify presentation, style or layout of a markup languages (HTML, XHTML, XML, SVG) but it is more common on web pages. The presentation, style or layout may refer to font, color, size, and position of the contents. It can also be used in adding animation to a web pages. It was developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. The idea for using CSS is to separate the presentational aspect from markup languages.</p>
