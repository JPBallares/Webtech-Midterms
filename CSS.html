        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets</h1>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to specify presentation, style or layout of a markup languages (HTML, XHTML, XML, SVG) but it is more common on web pages. The presentation, style or layout may refer to font, color, size, and position of the contents. It can also be used in adding animation to a web pages. It was developed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos. The idea for using CSS is to separate the presentational aspect from markup languages.</p>

                    <p>&lt;p style="color: white; background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</p>

                <p>A property can be declared !important meaning it is higher priority than the other property, it will not be overridden by property declared normal even if it is declared after the !important declaration. In some cases there might be two !important declaration for the same property, then we can look into the order of the origin to see which will be applied.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Order of Origin (Cascading)</h3>
                <p>When there are collision between properties, meaning the property is being declared multiply times in different style sheets, there is a order in which style sheet will be applied for the property (Highest to Lowest priority):</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>User important declarations </li>
                    <li>Author important declarations </li>
                    <li>Author normal declarations </li>
                    <li>User normal declarations </li>
                    <li>User agent declarations </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Note: When a property is declared in the same origin then the latest declaration will be one one that will apply.</p>
